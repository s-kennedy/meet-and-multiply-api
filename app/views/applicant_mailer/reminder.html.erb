<p>Dear <%= @applicant.firstname %>, </p>

<p>We haven't heard back from you yet about your participation at Meet & Mulitply. Did you receive the acceptance email we sent you? </p>

<p>We would love to have you at the event. Please confirm your participation today if you plan to come.</p>

<p>We will also need a photo of you and a short bio. This should be no more than 250 words and it should focus on how you fit the Adopter profile for <%= @originator %>. Please review the section called â€œDo you match the Adopter profile?" on the <a href="<%= @originator_page_url %>"><%= @originator %></a> page and take that into consideration for your bio. The photo and bio will be used in the event programme, which will be distributed to the event attendees. If you want to be in the programme, send us your bio and photo by the end of the day today.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact us if you have any follow-up questions. We look forward to seeing you on February 21!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>The Meet & Multiply team</p>
