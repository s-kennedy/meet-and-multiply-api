Dear <%= @applicant.firstname %>,

Thank you for applying to Meet & Multiply. You profile is a great fit for the types of partners <%= @originator %> is hoping to meet and we would love to have you at the event.

Please confirm your participation within the next 3 working days.

We will also need a photo of you and a short bio. This should be no more than 250 words and it should focus on how you fit the Adopter profile for <%= @originator %>. Please review the section called â€œDo you match the Adopter profile?" on the <%= @originator%> page at <%= @originator_page_url %> and take that into consideration for your bio. The photo and bio will be used in an overview of the participants, which will be distributed to the event attendees. If you are representing a company, please also send a short description of the company.

Please see the agenda at <%= @agenda_url %> for details on event location and how to get there.

Please note that all activities of the event will take place in English.

Feel free to contact us if you have any follow-up questions. We look forward to seeing you on February 21!

Regards,
The Meet & Multiply team
