<p>Please confirm your participation within the next 3 working days.</p>

<p>We will also need a photo of you and a short bio. This should be no more than 250 words and it should focus on how you fit the Adopter profile for <%= @originator %>.

The photo and bio will be used in an overview of the participants, which will be distributed to the event attendees. If you are representing a company, please also send a short description of the company.</p>
